# WebRTC-Local-Loop-iOS
A small demo project how to have the most simple setup possible for WebRTC on iOS. It's comparable to the [Peer Connection WebRTC Sample](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/pc1/) and built with Swift. It's a nice starting point for building bigger and more complex projects.

## Dependencies
* Swift 4.1
* The [WebRTC framework for iOS](https://webrtc.org/native-code/ios/) from Google
